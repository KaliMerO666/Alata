<p>Alata is an original typeface designed by <a href="https://www.2xux.com/">Spyros Zevelakis.</a></p>

<p>Alata is a geometric low contrast sans typeface that can feel monumental, serious and archaic. It draws inspiration from both Early 20th C poster lettering, epigraphic Greek mono line letters. Cuuriously the capitals letters draw influence from UK Lettering while in contrast the lower case is more continetal european in character.</p>
